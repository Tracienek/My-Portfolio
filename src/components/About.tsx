        I'm a junior front-end developer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java programming. 
        I have experience building responsive websites and small web applications, and I'm familiar with cloud computing concepts on AWS. 
        Additionally, I understand basic cybersecurity principles and software development processes such as Agile and Waterfall. 
        I'm passionate about creating user-friendly web interfaces and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skill set. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I have hands-on experience with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
        and frameworks such as React and Next.js. I love working with Tailwind CSS to build 
        beautiful and responsive layouts quickly. Besides coding, I pay attention to 
        web performance, accessibility, and SEO to ensure my websites are fast and user-friendly. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I’m currently looking for opportunities to work on exciting projects where I can grow 
        as a developer and contribute to a dynamic team. My ultimate goal is to become a 
        full-stack developer, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies. 
        I’m always eager to learn, adapt, and collaborate to create impactful digital experiences.
