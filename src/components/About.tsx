      <p className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        I'm a junior front-end developer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. 
        I have experience building responsive websites and small web applications, and I'm familiar with cloud computing concepts on AWS. 
        Additionally, I understand basic cybersecurity principles and software development processes such as Agile and Waterfall. 
        I'm passionate about creating user-friendly web interfaces and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skill set. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I have hands-on experience with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
        and frameworks such as React and Next.js. I love working with Tailwind CSS to build 
        beautiful and responsive layouts quickly. Besides coding, I pay attention to 
        web performance, accessibility, and SEO to ensure my websites are fast and user-friendly. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I'm currently seeking opportunities to contribute to dynamic development teams 
        where I can grow as a developer, take on real-world challenges, and enhance my full-stack capabilities. 
        My long-term goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer with strong technical and collaborative skills. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy solving logic puzzles and exploring UI/UX trends to enhance user experiences.
